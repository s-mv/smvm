# smvm - the smv virtual machine

The smv bytecode virtual machine is a monolith meant to be embedded in C
itself (as of now). This is mostly a personal project, a header-only VM
that can be embedded into larger systems.

Currently the docs are in making (or being "transported" from past
projects) so for now there's only [BYTECODE](./docs/BYTECODE.md). Updates
are major TODO.
